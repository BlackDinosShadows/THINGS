# THINGS
Just a couple of things to go with Starship Launch Expansion

Thanks to Sam the creator of SLE that have agreed with the posting of this modified version of SLE along my mod

DEPENDENCIES:
Starship Launch Expansion,
Starship Expansion Project,
Hullcam VDS

COMPATIBILITIES:
Pekka's Starship (with his deluge)

KNOWN ISSUES:
The Tower Panels have a slightly lower node than the tower making it higher at placement

# How To Install
If you have it you'll need to delete SLE and replace with the one in the download file to have the nodes and texture changes

After you'll just need to place what's in the GameData folder in your GameData

After that Enjoy !
